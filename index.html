          <p>
            According to this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-04/local-vaccine-rates-mirror-class-and-density-divides" style="color: #377eb8ff;">Bloomberg article</a>,
            political party affiliation has a strong correlation with vaccination
            rates across metro areas. In other words, metro areas with higher vaccination rates
            are more likely to skew Democratic in the polls. <br><br>

            This isn't <i>always</i> the case. There are places like
            Rosebud County, MT, where 76.2% of the population is fully vaxxed
            despite the polls going red in the 2020 election. There are also places
            like Fulton County, GA, where the Democratic vote won majority but 30.5%
            of the population is fully vaxxed. There are many other counties similar
            to these. <b>See if you can find some!</b> <br><br>

            This value-by-alpha map shows the percentage of the county population 
            that is fully vaccinated<sup>*</sup> using a qualitative color scheme. Red
            symbolizing smaller percentages of vaccination and green symbolizing larger
            percentages.<br><br>

            Each county's population class is shown as a function of transparency
            (alpha) â€” metro counties being fully opaque, micro counties being halfway
            transparent, and rural counties being nearly transparent. 2020 Presidential election
            results appear in the county info panel in the top right of the screen.<br><br>
